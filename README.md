# First attempt at SolidJS using SolidStart beta

Have been SolidJS-curious for a while but not really played with much, so when <a href="https://twitter.com/t3dotgg/status/1590443687460614144">Theo</a> started live-streaming an interview with dev <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanCarniato/status/1589653991511982080">Ryan Carniato</a> a few hours ago about the newly released SolidStart I figured I'd play with it while side-eye watching the stream. It's pretty cool so far.

I don't really know what I'm doing yet (I mean, it's just Shiny-Object-Syndrome at this point) , so it's just basically porting some simple stuff from a React app I've been working on, with a tiny bit of tailwind malarkey.
